🌐 Graph & MST Visualizer

A clean, interactive tool to visualize Graphs, Weighted Edges, and Minimum Spanning Trees using Kruskal’s Algorithm.

📌 Overview
This project is an interactive Graph Visualizer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on logic originally implemented in C++.

It allows users to:

Input nodes

Input weighted edges

Draw the graph visually using SVG

Compute Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using Kruskal’s Algorithm

Highlight MST edges and show total MST weight

Use a Demo Graph for quick presentation

The attractive UI makes it perfect for:

GTU college project

Viva presentation

Portfolio project

Algorithm demonstrations

🚀 Features
🔹 Node & Edge Input

Enter nodes like:
A,B,C,D,E

Enter weighted edges like:
A-B:2,B-C:1,C-D:4

🔹 Interactive Visualization

Nodes arranged in a circular layout

Self-loops supported

Multiple edges drawn with curve offsets

Weight labels clearly visible

🔹 Kruskal’s MST Algorithm

Sorts edges by weight

Uses Union-Find (Disjoint Set)

Highlights MST edges in green

Displays total MST weight at the top

🔹 Demo Button

One click loads a sample graph instantly — great for presentations.

▶️ How to Run

Download the project folder

Open final.html in any browser

Enter nodes

Enter edges

Click Draw Graph

Click Calculate MST

Or simply press Demo Graph

No backend or server needed — works fully offline.

📚 Algorithm Used
🟢 Kruskal’s Algorithm

Step 1: Sort all edges by weight

Step 2: Use Union-Find to detect cycles

Step 3: Add safe edges to MST

Step 4: Stop when MST has (n - 1) edges

Efficient and perfect for MST visualization.

🎯 Future Enhancements

Add Prim’s Algorithm visualization

Add animation for step-by-step Kruskal

Allow dragging nodes

Export graph as image

Light/Dark theme toggle
